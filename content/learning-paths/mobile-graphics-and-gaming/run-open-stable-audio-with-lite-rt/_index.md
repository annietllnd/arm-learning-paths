title: Generate audio with Stable Audio Open Small on LiteRT

minutes_to_complete: 30

who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers looking to deploy Stability AI's Open Stable Audio text-to-audio model on LiteRT (Lite Runtime) using an Android device.

learning_objectives:
    - Convert Open Stable Audio to LiteRT
    - Create a simple program to generate audio
    - Compile the application and accelerate it on Arm CPU
    - Run the application on an Android smartphone and generate an audio snippet


prerequisites:
    - A Linux x86 development machine with at least 8 GB of RAM
    - A [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) account
    - An Android phone and a cable to connect it to your development machine

author: Nina Drozd, TODO - add linkedIn, add more involved in the creation?
