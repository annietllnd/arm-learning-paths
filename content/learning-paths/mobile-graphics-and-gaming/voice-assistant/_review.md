            What is KleidiAI?
        answers:
            - An anime about a little AI lost in a giant world.
            - A software library
        correct_answer: 2
        explanation: >
            KleidiAI is an open-source software library that provides optimized
            performance-critical micro-kernels for artificial intelligence (AI)
            workloads tailored for Arm processors.

        question: >
            How does KleidiAI optimize performance?
        answers:
            - Lots of magic, and let's be honest, a bit of hard work
            - It takes advantage of different available Arm processor architectural features.
        correct_answer: 2
        explanation: >
            Processor architectural features, e.g., ``FEAT_DotProd``, when implemented, enable
            the software to use specific instructions dedicated to efficiently performing some
            tasks or computations. For example, when implemented, ``FEAT_DotProd`` adds the
            ``UDOT`` and ``SDOT`` 8-bit dot product instructions, which are critical for
            improving the performance of dot product computations.
