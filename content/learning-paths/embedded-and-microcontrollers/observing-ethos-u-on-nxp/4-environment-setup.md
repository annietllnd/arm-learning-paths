## For macOS: Build ExecuTorch in a Docker container

On macOS, it’s easiest to build ExecuTorch in an Ubuntu container. This keeps your toolchain consistent with the rest of the Learning Path and avoids gaps in macOS-native cross-compilers (for example, the Arm GNU Toolchain doesn’t provide an “AArch64 GNU/Linux target” for macOS).

This container isn’t part of the runtime deployment. It’s a build environment that produces the artifacts you later move onto the FRDM i.MX 93:

- Prebuilt ExecuTorch libraries you link into Cortex-M33 firmware
- `.pte` model files compiled for Ethos-U65

Keeping this step reproducible helps you focus on the actual bring-up milestone: booting custom firmware on Cortex-M33 and using Ethos-U65 for inference.

Start by installing and launching [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/).

Next, create a working directory for your container build:

   ```bash
   mkdir ubuntu-24-container
   ```

Now create a `Dockerfile` and switch into the directory:

   ```bash
   cd ubuntu-24-container
   touch Dockerfile
   ```

Add the following content to your `Dockerfile` to install a few basic tools in the image:

   ```dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu:24.04

   ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

   RUN apt update -y && \
       apt install -y \
       software-properties-common \
       curl vim git
   ```

   The `ubuntu:24.04` container image includes Python 3.12, which you use later in this Learning Path.

   Build the container image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t ubuntu-24-container .
   ```

Run the container and open an interactive shell:

   ```bash { output_lines = "2-3" }
   docker run -it ubuntu-24-container /bin/bash
   # Output will be the Docker container prompt
   root@<CONTAINER ID>:/#
   ```

If you already created a container before, reuse it instead of creating a new one.

First, list your containers to find the container ID:

```bash { output_lines = "2-4" }
docker ps -a
# Output
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE                    COMMAND      CREATED        STATUS                       PORTS  NAMES
0123456789ab  ubuntu-24-container  "/bin/bash"  27 hours ago   Exited (255) 59 minutes ago.        container_name
```

Then start the container and attach a shell:

```bash
docker start 0123456789ab
docker exec -it 0123456789ab /bin/bash
```

Once you’re inside the container, move to your home directory:

```bash
cd /root
```

## Install dependencies

Install the packages ExecuTorch needs to build. If you’re not running as root, prefix the commands with `sudo`.

   ```bash
   apt update
   apt install -y \
     python-is-python3 python3.12-dev python3.12-venv python3-pip \
     gcc g++ \
     make cmake \
     build-essential \
     ninja-build \
     libboost-all-dev
   ```

## Create a Python virtual environment

Create and activate a virtual environment so your Python packages stay scoped to this project:
   ```bash { output_lines = "3" }
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

## Get the ExecuTorch source code

Clone ExecuTorch and run the installation script:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pytorch/executorch.git
   cd executorch
   git checkout release/1.0
   ./install_executorch.sh
   ```
After the installation is finished, you should see the package in `pip list`:

```bash
pip list | grep executorch
```

## Set up the Arm toolchain

Initialize the Arm-specific environment and accept the EULA:
  
   ```bash
   ./examples/arm/setup.sh --i-agree-to-the-contained-eula
   ```

Then, source the environment variables:

   ```bash
   source ./examples/arm/arm-scratch/setup_path.sh
   ```

Finally, run the following script to set up the last dependencies:

   ```bash
   ./examples/arm/run.sh --build-only
   ```
