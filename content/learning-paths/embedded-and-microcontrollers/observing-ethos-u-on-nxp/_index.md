who_is_this_for: This is an introductory topic for developers and data scientists new to Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML), who want to observe ExecuTorch performance on a physical device.

learning_objectives:
    - Bring up a custom ExecuTorch `executor_runner` firmware on the FRDM i.MX 93 Cortex-M33 using Linux RemoteProc.
    - Compile an ExecuTorch `.pte` model for Ethos-U65 and run inference with NPU acceleration.
    - Understand how heterogeneous Arm systems split responsibilities across application cores, microcontrollers, and NPUs.
prerequisites:
    - An NXP [FRDM i.MX 93](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/development-boards-and-designs/frdm-i-mx-93-development-board:FRDM-IMX93) development board.
    - A USB Mini-B to USB Type-A cable, or a USB Mini-B to USB Type-C cable.
    - Completion of [Linux on an NXP FRDM i.MX 93 board](/learning-paths/embedded-and-microcontrollers/linux-nxp-board/) (Linux setup, login access, and file transfer).
    - Basic knowledge of Machine Learning concepts.
    - A host computer to compile ExecuTorch libraries.
