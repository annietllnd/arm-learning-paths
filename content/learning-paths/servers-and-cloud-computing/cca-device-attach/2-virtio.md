## Overview

This section introduces VirtIO in the context of CCA Realms, and explains how it enables secure data exchange between a Realm and the untrusted external world.

A Realm must eventually use physical devices to interact with the external world. The easiest way to achieve this is by using VirtIO, which provides a fast, high-level emulation layer. This is considered the first level of device attach, where access is mediated by the hypervisor using paravirtualized interfaces.

More advanced device attach features can be enabled by hardware security features like PCIe-TDISP (**T**EE **D**evice **I**nterface **S**ecurity **P**rotocol) and PCIe-IDE (**I**ntegrity
and **D**ata **E**ncryption), where the host OS assigns a physical device to a Realm. The Realm can then make security measurements on the physical device and include those in its attestation base.

### What is VirtIO?

VirtIO provides an efficient, paravirtualized I/O interface between Realms and host devices. It is an abstraction layer for virtual devices in virtualized environments. VirtIO is a standardized, efficient interface for virtual devices in virtualized environments. It lets guest operating systems use paravirtualized drivers to communicate with host-provided devices, avoiding the overhead of fully emulating physical hardware.

Paravirtualized means that the guest OS is aware itâ€™s running in a virtualized environment and can use optimized drivers (VirtIO) to communicate with virtual hardware. Emulating physical hardware devices (like NICs or disks) for VMs is slow and inefficient. VirtIO allows VMs to bypass full device emulation and use streamlined drivers.

VirtIO is most commonly used with KVM/QEMU virtualization. Example drivers include:

- `virtio-net`: paravirtualized networking
- `virtio-blk`: block storage
- `virtio-fs`: file sharing between host and guest
- `virtio-balloon`: dynamic memory management
- `virtio-rng`: random number source
- `virtio-console`: simple console interface

### How does VirtIO work in VMs?

Here is an overview of how VirtIO works in virtual machines:

1. The host hypervisor (for example, QEMU/KVM) exposes VirtIO backend devices
2. The guest OS loads VirtIO frontend drivers such as `virtio_net`or `virtio_blk` that communicate using the VirtIO protocol
3. I/O uses shared memory `virtqueues`, which avoids full device emulation
4. Devices are exposed over the PCI or MMIO bus to the guest

For example, instead of emulating an Intel e1000 NIC, the host exposes a `virtio-net` interface. The guest OS uses the `virtio-net` driver to exchange packets through shared buffers.

### Key takeaways

- VirtIO provides fast I/O through paravirtualization, not hardware emulation
- Shared queues reduce overhead and context switching
- It is the simplest and most common first step for device attach in Realms
